BigArrow
========

BigArrow is an Android app that started off with the idea of drawing an arrow pointing to the nearest pub by overlaying 
it onto the output from the camera. Details of pubs and other sorts of places come from the Google Places API. 
BigArrow is a student project at the University of Brighton released unthe MIT license. We'll be developing it to 
include other kinds of data and so that users can configure it in various ways.
