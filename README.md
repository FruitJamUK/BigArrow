BigArrow
========

BigArrow is an Android app that overlays an arrow pointing to the nearest pub onto the output from the camera.
Details of pubs come from the Google Places API. It is a student project at the University of Brighton, and 
we'll be developing it to include other kinds of data and so that users can configure it in various ways.
